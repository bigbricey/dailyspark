<p><em>Last updated: January 2025</em></p>
<p>"Your A1C is 7.2. You have Type 2 diabetes."</p>
<p>Those eight words changed everything. Not just my health. My finances. My future. My ability to stay self-employed.</p>
<p>Because what my doctor didn't say was: "By the way, your high-deductible insurance won't help with any of this. You'll pay roughly $12,000 out of pocket every year. Forever."</p>
<h2>The Cruel Math of Chronic Illness</h2>
<p>When you have diabetes and high-deductible insurance, here's your reality:</p>
<p><strong>Annual diabetes costs:</strong> $12,000 (average)
<strong>High deductible plan:</strong> $10,000
<strong>What insurance pays:</strong> $0 for the first $10,000
<strong>What you pay:</strong> Everything</p>
<p>Every. Single. Year.</p>
<p>The deductible resets January 1st. Your diabetes doesn't.</p>
<h2>My First Year: The Financial Bloodbath</h2>
<h3>The Medication Nightmare</h3>
<p><strong>Metformin:</strong> $30/month (generic, "cheap")
<strong>Jardiance:</strong> $550/month (no generic exists)
<strong>Insulin (when added):</strong> $340/month
<strong>Total monthly medications:</strong> $920
<strong>Annual medication cost:</strong> $11,040</p>
<p>That's before a single doctor visit. Before test strips. Before anything else.</p>
<h3>The Monitoring Costs</h3>
<p><strong>Glucose meter:</strong> $30
<strong>Test strips:</strong> $150/month (testing 4x daily)
<strong>Continuous Glucose Monitor:</strong> $350/month
<strong>Lancets:</strong> $20/month
<strong>Annual monitoring:</strong> $6,240</p>
<h3>The Doctor Visits</h3>
<p><strong>Endocrinologist:</strong> $400/visit x 4 yearly = $1,600
<strong>Primary care:</strong> $200/visit x 4 yearly = $800
<strong>Ophthalmologist:</strong> $350/year
<strong>Podiatrist:</strong> $200/year
<strong>Lab work:</strong> $800/quarter = $3,200
<strong>Annual medical visits:</strong> $6,150</p>
<h3>Year One Total: $23,430</h3>
<p>Insurance paid: $0 (hadn't hit deductible until November)
I paid: $23,430</p>
<h2>The Insurance Company's Sick Game</h2>
<p>Here's what they don't tell you about high deductibles and chronic conditions:</p>
<h3>The January Reset Disaster</h3>
<p>December 30th: Finally hit my $10,000 deductible
December 31st: Insurance now covers 80% of costs
January 1st: Deductible resets to $0
January 2nd: Back to paying 100% of everything</p>
<p>I get roughly 30 days of actual insurance coverage per year.</p>
<h3>The "Preventive Care" Lie</h3>
<p>Insurance companies advertise "free preventive care!" But for diabetics:
<ul><li>A1C tests? Not preventive - you already have diabetes</li>
<li>Eye exams? Only basic exam free, diabetic screening costs extra</li>
<li>Foot exams? Not covered</li>
<li>Nutritionist? Not covered</li>
<li>Diabetes education? Not covered</li>
</ul>
<p>"Preventive" only applies if you're healthy. Once you're sick, nothing is preventive.</p>
<h3>The Prior Authorization Hell</h3>
<p>Even after hitting my deductible, insurance requires prior authorization for:
<ul><li>CGM sensors (deny first request 70% of the time)</li>
<li>Newer medications (must "fail" on cheaper ones first)</li>
<li>Insulin pumps (6-month approval process)</li>
<li>More than 3 test strips per day</li>
</ul>
<p>Each denial means paying full price while appealing.</p>
<h2>The Real Cost Beyond Money</h2>
<h3>The Rationing Reality</h3>
<p>When insulin costs $340/month out of pocket, you ration:
<ul><li>Skip doses to make vial last longer</li>
<li>Reuse needles until they hurt</li>
<li>Test blood sugar twice daily instead of recommended 4-6 times</li>
<li>Eat the same foods to predict blood sugar without testing</li>
</ul>
<p>My A1C went from 7.2 to 8.9 because I couldn't afford proper management.</p>
<h3>The Complications Math</h3>
<p>Poor diabetes control leads to:
<ul><li>Neuropathy treatment: $5,000/year</li>
<li>Kidney disease: $50,000/year</li>
<li>Heart disease: $100,000+</li>
<li>Amputation: $70,000+</li>
<li>Blindness: Incalculable</li>
</ul>
<p>But insurance companies don't care about preventing these. They hope you'll switch plans before complications hit.</p>
<h2>The Impossible Choices</h2>
<p>Every month, I choose between:</p>
<p><strong>Option A: Full Diabetes Care</strong>
<ul><li>All medications: $920</li>
<li>Proper monitoring: $520</li>
<li>Doctor visits: $500</li>
<li>Total: $1,940/month</li>
<li>Result: Good control, financial ruin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option B: Bare Minimum</strong>
<ul><li>Generic metformin only: $30</li>
<li>Minimal testing: $50</li>
<li>Skip specialists: $0</li>
<li>Total: $80/month</li>
<li>Result: Poor control, future complications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option C: Alternative Solutions</strong>
This is where I discovered <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a>. </p>
<p>They offer:
<ul><li>Unlimited primary care visits</li>
<li>Basic diabetes management</li>
<li>Some included medications</li>
<li>Flat monthly rate: ~$150</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't cover insulin or expensive meds, but for basic diabetes care, it's been a lifeline. I use <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> for routine management and save my high-deductible insurance for emergencies.</p>
<h2>The System's Perverse Incentives</h2>
<h3>Insurance Wants You Sick (But Not Too Sick)</h3>
<p>Healthy people are profitable (pay premiums, no claims)
Very sick people are unprofitable (expensive claims)
Chronically ill people are MOST profitable:
<ul><li>Pay high premiums</li>
<li>Pay most costs themselves via deductible</li>
<li>Too scared to cancel coverage</li>
<li>Trapped in the system</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Deductible Discrimination</h3>
<p>High deductibles essentially mean:
<ul><li>Rich diabetics get care</li>
<li>Poor diabetics get complications</li>
<li>Middle-class diabetics go bankrupt trying</li>
</ul>
<p>It's healthcare apartheid based on wealth.</p>
<h2>The Corporate Job Temptation</h2>
<p>Every month, I look at job postings. Not because I want to work for someone else, but because:</p>
<p><strong>Corporate insurance typically offers:</strong>
<ul><li>$500 deductible</li>
<li>$20 copays</li>
<li>$10 generic drugs</li>
<li>$50 brand drugs</li>
<li>Annual diabetes cost: ~$2,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self-employed insurance:</strong>
<ul><li>$10,000 deductible</li>
<li>Full price everything</li>
<li>Annual diabetes cost: $12,000+</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference: $10,000/year. That's $833/month raise just for having employer insurance.</p>
<h2>What Other Countries Do</h2>
<p>My friend in Canada with diabetes pays:
<ul><li>Insulin: $30/month (government subsidized)</li>
<li>Supplies: $50/month</li>
<li>Doctor visits: $0</li>
<li>Total annual cost: $960</li>
</ul>
<p>My friend in Germany:
<ul><li>Everything covered after $600/year maximum</li>
<li>Total annual cost: $600</li>
</ul>
<p>Me in America:
<ul><li>Total annual cost: $12,000-23,000</li>
<li>Plus $24,000 in premiums</li>
</ul>
<p>We're the only developed nation that bankrupts diabetics.</p>
<h2>The Survival Strategies That Actually Work</h2>
<h3>1. Patient Assistance Programs</h3>
Most drug companies offer programs if you earn under 400% of poverty level. I get Jardiance for $0 through Boehringer Ingelheim's program.</p>
<h3>2. GoodRx and Discount Cards</h3>
Sometimes cheaper than insurance prices. Saved me $200/month on insulin.</p>
<h3>3. Walmart Insulin</h3>
$25/vial for older formulations. Not ideal but keeps you alive.</p>
<h3>4. Direct Primary Care</h3>
<a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> has been invaluable for routine care without deductible hassles.</p>
<h3>5. Medical Tourism</h3>
90-day insulin supply in Mexico: $300
Same supply in US: $3,000</p>
<h3>6. Clinical Trials</h3>
Free medication and care in exchange for participation.</p>
<h2>The Long-Term Reality</h2>
<p>Diabetes is forever. High deductibles reset annually. This means:</p>
<p><strong>10 years of diabetes with high-deductible plan:</strong>
<ul><li>Premiums: $240,000</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket: $120,000</li>
<li>Total: $360,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Same 10 years with employer insurance:</strong>
<ul><li>Premiums: $48,000</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket: $20,000</li>
<li>Total: $68,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Difference: $292,000</strong></p>
<p>That's a house. That's retirement. That's my kids' college. That's the cost of being diabetic and self-employed in America.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Having diabetes with a high-deductible plan isn't insurance - it's a subscription to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>You'll pay $10,000+ every year before insurance helps. Your chronic condition doesn't pause for deductible resets. Your need for insulin doesn't care about prior authorizations.</p>
<p>The system is designed to extract maximum profit from people who can't stop needing care.</p>
<p>My advice? 
<li>If you have a chronic condition, think hard before going self-employed</li>
<li>Research alternatives like <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a></li>
<li>Master every patient assistance program</li>
<li>Consider medical tourism for supplies</li>
<li>Never, ever let your corporate insurance lapse if you have it</li></p>
<p>Because in America, the cost of diabetes isn't measured in blood sugar. It's measured in dollars. And with a high-deductible plan, you'll pay every single one of them yourself.</p>

<p><em>Note: Costs based on actual Type 2 diabetes expenses with high-deductible insurance. Individual costs vary by medication needs, location, and complications.</em></p>
