<p><em>Last updated: January 2025</em></p>
<p>December 15th, 2023. Finally hit my $10,000 deductible after 11 months of medical bills.</p>
<p>December 16th: Insurance starts covering 80%. I schedule everything:
<ul><li>MRI for back pain (delayed 8 months)</li>
<li>Colonoscopy (overdue 2 years)</li>
<li>Skin cancer screening (suspicious mole for 6 months)</li>
<li>Dental surgery consultation</li>
</ul>
<p>December 31st, 11:59 PM: Coverage active.
January 1st, 12:00 AM: Back to zero. Pay full price for everything again.</p>
<p>16 days. That's how long my insurance actually worked.</p>
<h2>The December Rush Insanity</h2>
<p>Every December, doctor offices are packed with people like me trying to squeeze in procedures before the reset. It's healthcare's Black Friday, except we're panic-buying medical care.</p>
<p>My December 2023 speedrun:
<ul><li>December 16: Finally hit deductible</li>
<li>December 17: Called 14 specialists</li>
<li>December 18-31: Crammed in 8 appointments</li>
<li>December 28: Told cancer screening must wait until January</li>
<li>January 2: That screening now costs $3,400 instead of $680</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Waiting Room Conversations</h2>
<p>December 20th, orthopedic waiting room. Everyone comparing notes:</p>
<p><strong>Woman 1:</strong> "Been waiting since April for this knee surgery. Finally hit my deductible last week."</p>
<p><strong>Man 2:</strong> "Need both hips done. Getting right hip December 29th. Left hip will have to wait until next December after I hit the deductible again."</p>
<p><strong>Woman 3:</strong> "Having surgery December 31st. Doc is coming in on New Year's Eve just to beat the reset."</p>
<p>We're all racing the same clock.</p>
<h2>The Procedures I Couldn't Fit</h2>
<p>Despite cramming 8 appointments into 16 days, I missed:
<ul><li>Colonoscopy (booked through February)</li>
<li>Sleep study (no December slots)</li>
<li>Cardiac stress test (requires pre-authorization)</li>
<li>Wisdom teeth removal (oral surgeon on vacation)</li>
</ul>
<p>January 2nd costs for what I missed:
<ul><li>Colonoscopy: $3,200 (would have been $640)</li>
<li>Sleep study: $4,100 (would have been $820)</li>
<li>Stress test: $2,800 (would have been $560)</li>
<li>Wisdom teeth: $3,500 (would have been $700)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total cost of missing December: $13,600 vs $2,720</strong>
<strong>The reset cost me: $10,880</strong></p>
<h2>The Healthcare Rationing Calendar</h2>
<p>My actual healthcare schedule with high-deductible insurance:</p>
<p><strong>January-November:</strong> Avoid all non-emergency care. Pay cash for urgent issues. Delay everything possible.</p>
<p><strong>December 1-15:</strong> Pray something happens that pushes me over the deductible.</p>
<p><strong>December 16-31:</strong> MEDICAL EMERGENCY! Schedule everything humanly possible.</p>
<p><strong>January 1:</strong> Reset. Start avoiding care again.</p>
<p>This isn't healthcare. It's healthcare gambling with a calendar deadline.</p>
<h2>The Life-Threatening Delays</h2>
<h3>The Mole That Wasn't "Just a Mole"</h3>
<p>June 2023: Noticed irregular mole
July: Showed primary doctor
August: Referred to dermatologist
September-November: Waited to hit deductible
December 18: Finally got biopsy
December 28: Results: Melanoma
January 2: Surgery scheduled
January 2: Full price now: $8,400</p>
<p>Six months I waited with skin cancer because I couldn't afford the biopsy. The delay likely made it worse.</p>
<h3>The Heart Problem That Couldn't Wait</h3>
<p>October: Chest pains started
November: Getting worse
December 10: Still $1,200 from deductible
December 14: ER visit for severe pain
December 14: Heart catheterization needed
December 15: Hit deductible!
December 20: Cath scheduled
December 31: "We need to cancel, can't fit you in"
January 15: Finally get procedure
January 15: Pay full price: $18,000</p>
<h2>The Insurance Company's Perfect Scam</h2>
<p>They know exactly what they're doing:
<ul><li>Most people hit deductibles late in the year (if at all)</li>
<li>December scheduling is impossible</li>
<li>January reset means starting over</li>
<li>Result: Minimal actual coverage provided</li>
</ul>
<p>My insurance company's actual payout:
<ul><li>Premiums collected: $16,800</li>
<li>Actual benefits paid (16 days in December): $3,200</li>
<li>Profit: $13,600</li>
</ul>
<h2>The December Healthcare Horror Stories</h2>
<p><strong>Tom, Texas:</strong> "Diagnosed with prostate cancer December 20th. Surgery scheduled January 5th. Reset cost me $15,000."</p>
<p><strong>Maria, California:</strong> "Started chemo December 15th. January 1st, can't afford to continue. Cancer doesn't care about deductible resets."</p>
<p><strong>David, New York:</strong> "Both knees need replacement. Did right knee December 28th. Left knee has to wait until next December. Walking with one bad knee for a year."</p>
<h2>What Other Countries Do</h2>
<p><strong>Every other developed nation:</strong> Healthcare doesn't reset. If you need care in December, you get it. If you need care in January, you get it. Same price (usually free).</p>
<p><strong>USA:</strong> Sorry, the calendar says you're poor again.</p>
<h2>The Alternative That Makes Sense</h2>
<p>This is where services like <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> shine. No deductible resets. Same price every month. December care costs the same as January care.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a>:
<ul><li>Flat monthly rate year-round</li>
<li>No rushing to squeeze in December care</li>
<li>No avoiding care January-November</li>

</ul>
<p>I'm seriously considering switching to <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> for primary care and keeping catastrophic insurance for emergencies only.</p>
<h2>The Scheduling Nightmare</h2>
<h3>December 17th Call Log:</h3>
<ul><li>Gastroenterologist: "Next available December slot is... next December"</li>
<li>Dermatologist: "We can squeeze you in December 29th at 6 AM"</li>
<li>Cardiologist: "December is fully booked, how's February?"</li>
<li>Orthopedist: "December 31st, 4 PM, take it or leave it"</li>
<li>Endocrinologist: "We don't schedule December appointments anymore"</li>
</ul>
<p>8 hours of calling. 3 appointments secured. 5 procedures pushed to full-price January.</p>
<h2>The Financial Planning Impossibility</h2>
<p>How do you budget when healthcare costs depend on calendar dates?</p>
<p><strong>Same procedure, different months:</strong>
<ul><li>November: $3,000 (haven't met deductible)</li>
<li>December 20th: $600 (met deductible)</li>
<li>January 5th: $3,000 (reset to zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the same body, same problem, same treatment. The only difference is what day the calendar says.</p>
<h2>The Mental Health Impact</h2>
<h3>December Anxiety</h3>
Racing to schedule everything, knowing you're running out of time.</p>
<h3>January Depression</h3>
Knowing you need care but can't afford it anymore.</p>
<h3>Year-Round Fear</h3>
Avoiding necessary care because the timing isn't "financially optimal."</p>
<h3>The Guilt</h3>
"Should have gotten sick in December" - as if we control when illness strikes.</p>
<h2>My 2024 Resolution That Failed</h2>
<p>January 1, 2024: "This year, I'll plan better. Save monthly for the deductible. Schedule strategically."</p>
<p>Reality:
<ul><li>February: Son's broken arm ate savings</li>
<li>May: Car repair ate medical fund</li>
<li>August: Lost client, income dropped</li>
<li>November: Still hadn't hit deductible</li>
<li>December: The panic rush again</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't plan for the reset when life doesn't follow calendars.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The January 1st deductible reset is cruel, arbitrary, and dangerous. It forces us to:
<ul><li>Delay necessary care 11 months of the year</li>
<li>Rush dangerous procedures in December</li>
<li>Start over broke every January</li>
<li>Treat healthcare like a seasonal sale</li>
</ul>
<p>My melanoma didn't care it was June. My heart didn't wait for December. But my insurance company only cared about the calendar.</p>
<p>16 days. That's how long my insurance actually helped in 2023. </p>
<p>$16,800 in premiums for 16 days of coverage.</p>
<p>That's $1,050 per day of actual insurance.</p>
<p>Next December, I'll race the calendar again. And January 1st, I'll lose again.</p>
<p>Because in America, your deductible resets, but your illness doesn't.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>Note: Based on actual December 2023 healthcare rush and January 2024 reset impact. Individual December panic and January poverty may vary.</em></p>
