## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. **NO PRIVACY POLICY - GDPR/CCPA VIOLATION**
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Potential Fine:** $20M or 4% of revenue (GDPR), $7,500 per violation (CCPA)  
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 13/14, California Civil Code ¬ß1798.100  

**Issue:** Website has NO privacy policy despite:
- Footer links to "/privacy.html" on every page (broken links)
- Contact email collecting user data
- Potential cookie usage
- Affiliate tracking pixels from AWIN

**REQUIRED FIX:**
Create comprehensive privacy policy covering:
- What data is collected (IP addresses, cookies, email)
- How it's used (affiliate tracking, communications)
- Third-party sharing (AWIN, MyPhysicianPlan)
- User rights (access, deletion, opt-out)
- Cookie consent requirements
- Contact information for data requests

### 2. **NO TERMS OF SERVICE - CONTRACT VULNERABILITY**
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Potential Impact:** Unlimited liability exposure  
**Issue:** No terms limiting liability, establishing jurisdiction, or protecting content

**REQUIRED FIX:**
Create terms of service including:
- Limitation of liability clauses
- No warranty disclaimers
- Intellectual property rights
- User conduct rules
- Arbitration clause
- DMCA provisions

### 3. **INCONSISTENT AFFILIATE LINKS - AWIN VIOLATION**
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Potential Impact:** Account termination, commission forfeiture  
**AWIN Terms Violation:** Section 4.2 - Proper Link Format

**Issues Found:**
- Some articles use proper AWIN tracking: `https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221`
- Others use broken format: `https://myphysicianplan.com?tag=yourtag-20` (Amazon tag on wrong program!)
- Mixing of tracking methods violates AWIN terms

**REQUIRED FIX:**
ALL affiliate links must use exact AWIN format:
```html
https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com
```

### 4. **INSUFFICIENT FTC DISCLOSURE PLACEMENT**
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**FTC Fine:** Up to $51,744 per page  
**Regulation:** 16 CFR Part 255 - FTC Endorsement Guides

**Issues:**
- Disclosure box exists but uses weak language
- Not "clear and conspicuous" enough
- Should state explicitly: "As an affiliate, we earn commissions from qualifying purchases"
- Must appear BEFORE first affiliate link, not just at top

**REQUIRED FIX:**
Strengthen disclosure to:
```html
<div class="disclosure-box" style="background: #fff3cd; border: 2px solid #ff0000;">
    <strong>AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE:</strong>
    We are a participant in the AWIN affiliate program. This means we earn commissions 
    when you purchase MyPhysicianPlan through our links. This costs you nothing extra 
    but helps support our site. We only recommend products we believe will help our readers.
</div>
```

### 5. **NO MEDICAL DISCLAIMER - LIABILITY RISK**
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Potential Lawsuits:** Medical malpractice, personal injury claims  
**Issue:** Discussing health insurance alternatives without proper medical disclaimer

**REQUIRED FIX:**
Add to EVERY article:
```html
<div class="medical-disclaimer">
    <strong>MEDICAL DISCLAIMER:</strong>
    This content is for informational purposes only and is not medical advice. 
    Health insurance decisions should be made in consultation with qualified 
    insurance agents and healthcare providers. Individual results and coverage may vary.
</div>
```

## üî∂ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Should Fix Before Launch)

### 6. **Unsubstantiated Income Claims**
**Risk:** FTC investigation for deceptive practices  
**Found in:** Multiple articles claiming specific dollar savings without evidence
- "Save $11,479" 
- "$46,500 saved with one call"
- "Saving $1,700/month"

**FIX:** Add "individual results may vary" or provide substantiation data

### 7. **No Cookie Consent Banner**
**Risk:** GDPR/CCPA violations  
**Issue:** AWIN uses tracking cookies but no consent mechanism

**FIX:** Implement cookie consent banner before any cookies are set

### 8. **Missing Email Compliance (Future Risk)**
**Risk:** CAN-SPAM violations if email collection begins  
**Current Status:** Only contact email shown, no newsletter signup found

**FIX IF ADDING EMAIL:** Include physical address, unsubscribe mechanism

### 9. **Misleading Urgency Claims**
**Risk:** FTC deceptive practices  
**Examples:** "December Income Panic", "Emergency" language

**FIX:** Ensure all urgency is factual and time-bound

### 10. **No About Page or Author Information**
**Risk:** Reduces credibility, FTC prefers transparency  
**Issue:** "DailySpark Team" with no real information

**FIX:** Create About page with real business information

---

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS (Best Practices)

### 11. **Add State-Specific Disclaimers**

### 12. **Implement Schema Markup**
Add Article schema to improve search visibility and compliance

### 13. **Create Dedicated Disclosure Page**
Link to comprehensive affiliate disclosure explaining all partnerships

### 14. **Add Social Proof Disclaimers**
