<p><em>Last updated: January 2025</em></p>
<p>Tuesday, 2 AM. Pain so bad I thought I was dying.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 6 AM. Waking up from emergency surgery minus one appendix.</p>
<p>Thursday, 10 AM. Hospital billing department explaining how I "won" the insurance lottery because I'll "only" pay $14,600 of the $33,000 bill.</p>
<p>They said it with a straight face. Like I should be grateful.</p>
<h2>The Bill That Made Me Vomit (Not from Surgery)</h2>
<p><strong>Total Hospital Charges: $33,000</strong></p>
<p>Here's how my "excellent" high-deductible insurance handled it:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: The Deductible Hit</strong>
<ul><li>First $10,000: I pay 100%</li>
<li>Insurance pays: $0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2: The Coinsurance Kick</strong>
<ul><li>Next $23,000: I pay 20% ($4,600)</li>
<li>Insurance pays: 80% ($18,400)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Total: $14,600</strong>
<strong>Insurance Total: $18,400</strong></p>
<p>They covered more than I did! I won! Except... I still owe $14,600 for an organ removal I had no choice about.</p>
<h2>The Itemized Insanity</h2>
<p>I requested an itemized bill. I wish I hadn't:</p>
<p><strong>Operating Room (2 hours): $8,500</strong>
<ul><li>That's $4,250 per hour</li>
<li>Or $70.83 per minute</li>
<li>To use a room</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anesthesia: $3,200</strong>
<ul><li>Thank God I was unconscious for these prices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Surgeon's Fee: $6,500</strong>
<ul><li>Fair enough, she saved my life</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recovery Room (3 hours): $2,400</strong>
<ul><li>$800/hour to lie in a bed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regular Room (18 hours): $3,600</strong>
<ul><li>$200/hour for a shared room</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medications:</strong>
<ul><li>Tylenol (2 doses): $47 each = $94</li>
<li>IV antibiotics: $380 per bag x 4 = $1,520</li>
<li>Anti-nausea medication: $89</li>
<li>IV saline bag: $284 (it's salt water!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supplies:</strong>
<ul><li>Surgical gloves: $53</li>
<li>Gown: $84</li>
<li>Blanket (they let me keep it): $140</li>
<li>Tissues: $11 (not a typo)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Labs and Imaging:</strong>
<ul><li>CT scan: $3,400</li>
<li>Blood work: $1,800</li>
<li>Urinalysis: $92</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong>
<ul><li>"Mucus recovery system": $213 (it's a tissue box)</li>
<li>"Thermal therapy": $97 (an ice pack)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The "You're Lucky" Gaslight</h2>
<p>Everyone kept telling me how lucky I was:</p>
<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> "Lucky they caught it before it burst!"
<strong>Surgeon:</strong> "Lucky you have insurance!"
<strong>Billing:</strong> "Lucky you hit your deductible!"
<strong>Insurance:</strong> "Lucky we cover 80% after deductible!"</p>
<p>Lucky? I'm $14,600 poorer for an emergency I couldn't prevent, predict, or postpone.</p>
<h2>What This Actually Cost in Other Countries</h2>
<p>I researched this while on morphine:</p>
<p><strong>Canada:</strong> $0 (maybe $15 for parking)
<strong>UK:</strong> £0 
<strong>Australia:</strong> $0 (with Medicare)
<strong>Germany:</strong> €10/day hospital fee
<strong>Japan:</strong> ¥100,000 max (~$700)
<strong>Singapore:</strong> $2,000-4,000 SGD
**Mexico (paying cash): $3,000 USD
<strong>USA with high-deductible: $14,600</strong></p>
<p>I could have flown first-class to Singapore, had the surgery, recovered at the Ritz Carlton for a week, and flown back for less than I paid here.</p>
<h2>The Payment Plan Prison</h2>
<p>"Don't worry," billing said, "we offer payment plans!"</p>
<p>Their generous offer:
<ul><li>$14,600 over 24 months</li>
<li>$608.33 per month</li>
<li>0% interest (how kind!)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a car payment. For two years. For an organ I no longer have.</p>
<h2>The Timing Torture</h2>
<h3>If This Happened in January:</h3>
<ul><li>Full $14,600 out of pocket</li>
<li>But deductible met for the year</li>
<li>Rest of year's care would be "cheaper"</li>
</ul>
<h3>But It Happened in October:</h3>
<ul><li>Paid $14,600</li>
<li>Deductible met!</li>
<li>November-December: Some coverage</li>
<li>January 1st: Reset to zero</li>
<li>Start over</li>
</ul>
<p>I paid maximum price for minimum benefit duration.</p>
<h2>The "What If" Scenarios That Haunt Me</h2>
<h3>What If I'd Waited?</h3>
<p>People ask why Americans delay emergency care. This is why.</p>
<p>I almost didn't go to the ER. Almost tried to "sleep it off." At $14,600, can you blame me?</p>
<p>If it had burst while I waited: Sepsis, ICU, possible death. Or worse: survival with $200,000 in bills.</p>
<h3>What If I Had No Insurance?</h3>
<p>Cash price (I asked): $18,000
Payment plan available
Charity care possible</p>
<p><strong>Without insurance: $18,000 (negotiable)</strong>
<strong>With insurance: $14,600 (non-negotiable)</strong></p>
<p>I saved $3,400 by paying $16,800 in annual premiums. That math doesn't math.</p>
<h3>What If I'd Used Alternative Coverage?</h3>
<p>Services like <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> couldn't help with emergency surgery, but they could have handled all my follow-up care for a flat monthly rate instead of per-visit charges.</p>
<p>Post-surgery I needed:
<ul><li>4 follow-up visits: $200 each = $800</li>
<li>Wound care supplies: $340</li>
<li>Lab work: $400</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> would have covered all that for their flat fee of ~$150/month instead of $1,540 in follow-up costs.</p>
<h2>The Recovery Bill Shock</h2>
<p>The surgery was just the beginning:</p>
<p><strong>Week 1 Post-Op:</strong>
<ul><li>Pain meds (not covered): $180</li>
<li>Follow-up visit: $200</li>
<li>Wound care supplies: $340</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 2:</strong>
<ul><li>Infection scare, urgent care: $350</li>
<li>Antibiotics: $90</li>
<li>Second follow-up: $200</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 4:</strong>
<ul><li>Final surgical follow-up: $200</li>
<li>Lab work: $400</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 6:</strong>
<ul><li>Return to work clearance: $150</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total follow-up costs: $2,110</strong>
<strong>Insurance paid: $0 (new year, deductible reset)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grand total for appendix removal: $16,710</strong></p>
<h2>The Psychological Aftermath</h2>
<h3>Medical PTSD</h3>
I now ignore symptoms because I'm terrified of bills. Chest pain? Probably nothing. Severe headache? Take Advil. </p>
<p>This will probably kill me someday, but at least my family won't inherit medical debt.</p>
<h3>The Guilt</h3>
I feel guilty for getting appendicitis. Like I should apologize to my family for my organ failing. "Sorry honey, my body cost us our vacation fund."</p>
<h3>The Rage</h3>
I pay $16,800/year in premiums and still had to pay $14,600 for emergency surgery. The insurance company made money off my medical emergency.</p>
<h2>What Other People Paid (Real Reddit Stories)</h2>
<p><strong>"Paid $22,000 for burst appendix. USA! USA!"</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Canadian here. Total cost: $0. Sorry."</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Had appendectomy in Thailand on vacation. Total: $2,000. Hospital was nicer than US."</strong></p>
<p><strong>"$31,000 after insurance. Filing bankruptcy."</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Flew to Mexico. Total with flight: $4,000."</strong></p>
<h2>The System Working as Designed</h2>
<p>This isn't a bug. It's a feature. Insurance companies know:</p>
<p><li>You can't shop around during appendicitis</li>
<li>You can't delay emergency surgery</li>
<li>You'll pay anything to not die</li>
<li>You're grateful to "only" pay $14,600</li></p>
<p>It's the perfect crime. Legal extortion. Pay or die, then pay anyway.</p>
<h2>Survival Guide for High-Deductible Appendectomies</h2>
<p><li><strong>Have $15,000 saved</strong> (yeah, right)</li>
<li><strong>Get it in December</strong> (deductible already met)</li>
<li><strong>Consider medical tourism</strong> (if not emergency)</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate everything</strong> (while recovering from surgery)</li>
<li><strong>Look into assistance programs</strong> (if you qualify)</li>
<li><strong>Use <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> for follow-ups</strong> (save on post-op care)</li></p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>In America's healthcare lottery, having your appendix removed with "good" insurance means:
<ul><li>You pay: $14,600</li>
<li>Insurance pays: $18,400</li>
<li>You're told you're lucky</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't insurance. It's a partial discount program with a $16,800 annual membership fee.</p>
<p>My appendix tried to kill me. The bill almost finished the job.</p>
<p>But hey, at least I "won" the insurance lottery.</p>
<p>Next time, I'm buying a lottery ticket instead of health insurance. Better odds, better payout, and at least when I lose, it only costs a dollar.</p>
