        <h1>The Preventive Care Lie: What's Actually Free vs What Bankrupts You</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: January 2025</em></p>
<p>"Don't worry, preventive care is 100% free with all ACA plans!"</p>
<p>That's what the insurance agent said. That's what the website said. That's what everyone said.</p>
<p>What they didn't say: Their definition of "preventive" is so narrow that a papercut wouldn't qualify.</p>
<p>Last month's "preventive" care visit bill: $1,847.</p>
<h2>What They Claim Is Free</h2>
<p>According to healthcare.gov, these preventive services are covered 100%:
<ul><li>Annual wellness visit</li>
<li>Basic immunizations</li>
<li>"Certain" screenings</li>
<li>"Some" preventive medications</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great! Except...</p>
<h2>What Actually Happened at My "Free" Preventive Visit</h2>
<p><strong>My Annual Wellness Visit Breakdown:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Free parts:</strong>
<ul><li>Blood pressure check: $0</li>
<li>Weight check: $0</li>
<li>Basic blood panel: $0</li>
<li>Depression screening questionnaire: $0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Surprise charges:</strong>
<ul><li>"I've been having headaches": $295 (problem-focused visit)</li>
<li>"My knee hurts when I run": $340 (additional complaint)</li>
<li>Vitamin D test: $127 (not considered preventive)</li>
<li>Thyroid panel: $289 (not basic screening)</li>
<li>EKG (I'm 45): $380 (not preventive until 50)</li>
<li>Extended discussion about diet: $200 (counseling beyond scope)</li>
<li>Skin check for moles: $216 (dermatology referral needed)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total "free" preventive visit: $1,847</strong></p>
<h2>The Exact Words That Cost You Money</h2>
<p>Say these during your "free" visit and watch charges appear:</p>
<p><strong>"I've been feeling..."</strong> - Boom, problem-focused visit, $295</p>
<p><strong>"Can you check this?"</strong> - Diagnostic exam, $200+</p>
<p><strong>"Should I be worried about...?"</strong> - Medical consultation, $340</p>
<p><strong>"My family has a history of..."</strong> - Risk assessment, $275</p>
<p><strong>"Last month I noticed..."</strong> - Symptom evaluation, $380</p>
<p>The second you mention ANYTHING wrong, it's no longer preventive.</p>
<h2>The Colonoscopy Scam</h2>
<p>Colonoscopy screening is "free" at 45. Here's what they don't tell you:</p>
<p><strong>The "Free" Colonoscopy:</strong>
<ul><li>Screening colonoscopy: $0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Actual Bill:</strong>
<ul><li>Anesthesia: $1,100 (not included in "free")</li>
<li>Facility fee: $800 (separate from procedure)</li>
<li>Polyp removal: $1,400 (now it's "treatment" not screening)</li>
<li>Pathology: $580 (testing the polyp)</li>
<li>Recovery room: $340</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total "free" colonoscopy: $4,220</strong></p>
<p>If they find ANYTHING, even a benign polyp, it instantly converts from preventive screening to medical treatment. Full price.</p>
<h2>The Mammogram Trap</h2>
<p><strong>"Free" screening mammogram:</strong>
<ul><li>Basic mammogram: $0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What actually happens:</strong>
<ul><li>"Dense breast tissue, need additional views": $340</li>
<li>Ultrasound follow-up: $450</li>
<li>Suspicious area found: $890 (diagnostic now)</li>
<li>Biopsy recommended: $2,400</li>
<li>It's benign but now you need monitoring: $600 every 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total for "free" mammogram cascade: $4,680</strong></p>
<h2>The Blood Work Bait and Switch</h2>
<p><strong>What's actually free:</strong>
<ul><li>Basic metabolic panel</li>
<li>Complete blood count</li>
<li>Cholesterol (once per year)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you probably need but isn't free:</strong>
<ul><li>Vitamin D: $127</li>
<li>B12: $98</li>
<li>Thyroid (TSH): $145</li>
<li>A1C (if not diabetic): $89</li>
<li>Hormone levels: $340</li>
<li>Inflammation markers: $215</li>
</ul>
<p>Doctor orders the "full panel." You think it's covered. Bill arrives: $1,014.</p>
<h2>The Vaccination Lies</h2>
<p><strong>Actually free vaccines:</strong>
<ul><li>Flu shot</li>
<li>COVID vaccine</li>
<li>Childhood vaccines (if you're a child)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vaccines that should be free but aren't:</strong>
<ul><li>Shingles vaccine (before 50): $450</li>
<li>Travel vaccines: $200-800 each</li>
<li>Hepatitis B (adults): $340</li>
<li>HPV (over 26): $750</li>
</ul>
<p>"Preventive care includes vaccinations!" *Terms and conditions apply</p>
<h2>The Prescription Prevention Scam</h2>
<p><strong>Free preventive medications:</strong>
<ul><li>Aspirin (for some)</li>
<li>Folic acid (if pregnant)</li>
<li>Few others</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preventive meds that aren't free:</strong>
<ul><li>Statins (prevent heart disease): $180/month</li>
<li>Blood pressure meds (prevent stroke): $140/month</li>
<li>Diabetes prevention meds: $340/month</li>
<li>Osteoporosis prevention: $280/month</li>
</ul>
<p>They're literally called PREVENTIVE medications. Still full price.</p>
<h2>Real Examples of "Preventive" Care Bills</h2>
<p><strong>Sarah's Story:</strong>
"Went for free annual exam. Mentioned irregular periods. Doctor did exam. Bill: $1,240. They coded it as 'diagnostic' because I had a symptom."</p>
<p><strong>Mike's Story:</strong>
"Free prostate screening. PSA slightly elevated. Needed follow-up ultrasound and biopsy. Total: $3,800. Original screening was free though!"</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer's Story:</strong>
"Free skin cancer screening. Found suspicious mole. Biopsy: $580. Removal: $1,200. Follow-ups: $400 each. The free screening cost me $3,000."</p>
<h2>What Other Countries Consider Preventive</h2>
<p><strong>Canada:</strong> Everything that prevents worse problems. Period.</p>
<p><strong>UK:</strong> If it stops future illness, it's covered.</p>
<p><strong>Japan:</strong> Prevention is healthcare. No distinction.</p>
<p><strong>USA:</strong> Only these 47 specific services under these 193 specific conditions on alternating Tuesdays if you haven't eaten gluten.</p>
<h2>The Direct Primary Care Difference</h2>
<p>This is where <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> makes sense. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a>:
<ul><li>Annual visits include whatever you need to discuss</li>
<li>No surprise billing for asking questions</li>
<li>Actual preventive care, not insurance-defined prevention</li>
<li>One flat rate whether you mention symptoms or not</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional insurance punishes you for being thorough about your health. <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> encourages it.</p>
<h2>How to Game the "Free" Visit System</h2>
<h3>The Two-Visit Strategy:</h3>
<li>First visit: ONLY do free screening, say NOTHING about symptoms</li>
<li>Second visit: Address actual health concerns</li>
<li>Costs more but avoids surprise bills</li></p>
<h3>The Magic Words:</h3>
<ul><li>Say: "I'm here for my annual preventive care visit"</li>
<li>Don't say: Anything about how you actually feel</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Pre-Visit Call:</h3>
"If I mention X during my preventive visit, will I be charged?"
Get it in writing.</p>
<h3>The Billing Review:</h3>
Always appeal preventive care bills. Sometimes they code it wrong "accidentally."</p>
<h2>The Psychological Damage</h2>
<p>We're trained to NOT mention health concerns during health visits.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>We go to the doctor but stay silent about symptoms to avoid charges.</p>
<p>That's not preventive care. That's preventive silence.</p>
<h2>The Real Cost of "Free" Preventive Care</h2>
<p>My 2024 "free" preventive care:
<ul><li>Annual physical that became diagnostic: $1,847</li>
<li>"Free" colonoscopy with polyp: $4,220</li>
<li>"Free" flu shot with travel vaccine question: $450</li>
<li>"Free" mammogram for wife: $2,100</li>
<li>"Free" kids' checkups with concerns: $890</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total for "free" preventive care: $9,507</strong></p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>"Free preventive care" is like "free shipping" that requires a $10,000 minimum order.</p>
<p>It exists, technically. But the moment you actually need healthcare - the moment you mention a symptom, find a polyp, need a vitamin level, or ask a question - it stops being free.</p>
<p>The insurance company's definition of preventive: You're perfectly healthy and just confirming it.</p>
<p>The actual definition of preventive: Catching problems early to prevent worse outcomes.</p>
<p>These definitions are opposites.</p>
<p>So yes, preventive care is free. As long as you don't need any actual healthcare during your healthcare visit.</p>
<p>The lie isn't that preventive care is free. The lie is calling it healthcare at all.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>Note: Based on actual "free" preventive care visits and subsequent bills. Individual charges for mentioning symptoms during wellness visits may vary by how greedy your provider is.</em></p>
