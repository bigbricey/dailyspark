        <p><em>Last updated: January 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>Three weeks into my American dream, I woke up with severe stomach pain.</p>
        <p>The campus health center was closed. My roommate drove me to the ER.</p>
        <p>Four hours later, I had:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A $47,000 hospital bill</li>
            <li>A panic attack</li>
            <li>No idea how American healthcare worked</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My university's "required" insurance? Didn't kick in for another week.</p>
        
        <h2>The Insurance Maze Nobody Explains at Orientation</h2>
        
        <div class="cost-box">
            <h3>University Insurance is Insanely Expensive</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Average cost: $2,500-4,000 per year</li>
                <li>Often doesn't cover dental or vision</li>
                <li>High deductibles ($500-1,500)</li>
                <li>Limited coverage during breaks</li>
                <li>Doesn't cover you if you travel home</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <p><strong>The "Mandatory" Insurance Isn't Always Mandatory</strong></p>
            <p>Many universities let you waive their insurance if you have comparable coverage. They just don't advertise this because they profit from their plans.</p>

        <h2>The Hidden Traps That Destroy Student Budgets</h2>
        
        <div class="cost-box">
            <h3>Trap #1: Summer Coverage Gap</h3>
            <p>Your spring coverage ends in May. Fall coverage starts in August. What happens if you get sick in July? You're uninsured.</p>
            <p><strong>One student's story:</strong> Broke her ankle in June. $12,000 bill. No coverage.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="cost-box">
            <h3>Trap #2: The "Student Health Center First" Rule</h3>
            <p>Many university plans REQUIRE you to visit campus health first. Skip this step? Insurance won't cover your outside visit.</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Campus health has banker's hours and is closed weekends.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="cost-box">
            <h3>Trap #3: Pre-Existing Conditions</h3>
            <p>University plans often exclude pre-existing conditions for 6-12 months. Have asthma? Diabetes? Depression? You're paying out-of-pocket for a year.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>MyPhysicianPlan: The Option Universities Don't Want You to Know About</h2>

        <h2>My Advice After 5 Years in the US</h2>
        
        <p>Don't be me. Don't wait until you have a $47,000 bill to figure out healthcare.</p>
        
        <p>If I could do it over, I'd:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Skip university insurance</li>
            <li>Sign up for <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> immediately</li>
            <li>Add cheap catastrophic coverage</li>
            <li>Save the difference ($2,000+/year)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>That saved money? That's a flight home. Or food for a semester. Or peace of mind knowing you can actually afford to see a doctor when you're sick.</p>
