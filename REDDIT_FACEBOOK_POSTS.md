## POST 1: The $1 Mistake Story (Reddit/Facebook)
**Target:** r/selfemployed, r/freelance, self-employed Facebook groups

**Title:** Made $1 too much last year. It cost me $11,479 in healthcare subsidies.

**Body:**
I'm a freelance designer and thought having a good year was a win. Made $64,001 instead of $64,000.

That ONE extra dollar pushed me over the ACA subsidy cliff. Lost my entire healthcare subsidy. Had to pay back $11,479 to the IRS.

I had NO idea this cliff existed. Nobody warns you about this.

If you're self-employed and make anywhere near $64,000, you need to understand how this works BEFORE it destroys you financially.

I wrote about what happened and how to avoid it: https://dailyspark.info/aca-subsidy-cliff.html

Don't make the same mistake I did.

## POST 2: The High Deductible Reality (Reddit/Facebook)
**Target:** r/HealthInsurance, r/personalfinance, healthcare Facebook groups

**Title:** Paid $650/month for health insurance. Still paid $7,500 before insurance covered ANYTHING.

**Body:**
Self-employed here. Paying $650/month for a "bronze" plan through the ACA marketplace.

Thought I was covered. Then my kid broke his arm.

$7,500 out of pocket before insurance paid a dime. On top of the $7,800/year in premiums I was already paying.

Total: $15,300 for ONE broken arm.

The high deductible plans are a trap for self-employed people, but nobody explains this clearly when you're signing up.

I wish I'd understood this before enrollment: https://dailyspark.info/high-deductible-reality.html

If you're self-employed and choosing a health plan, read this first.

## POST 3: The Wife's Job Trap (Reddit/Facebook)  
**Target:** r/selfemployed, r/marriedlife, entrepreneur Facebook groups

**Title:** My wife's $15/hour part-time job cost us $18,000 in healthcare subsidies

**Body:**
I'm self-employed making around $55,000/year. Was getting great ACA subsidies - paid only $200/month for family coverage.

My wife wanted to work part-time at Target. $15/hour, 20 hours a week.

Her income ($15,600/year) pushed our household over the subsidy cliff.

Lost ALL our subsidies. Now paying $1,700/month for the same coverage.

Her job brings in $15,600 but costs us $18,000 in extra healthcare premiums.

Nobody explained this would happen. Spent months trying to figure out why our premiums skyrocketed.

If your spouse is thinking about getting a job and you're on ACA subsidies, read this first: https://dailyspark.info/spouse-job-trap.html

## POST 4: Florida Healthcare Trap (Reddit/Facebook - Florida-Specific)
**Target:** r/florida, r/jacksonville, Florida Facebook groups

**Title:** Florida rejected Medicaid expansion. If you make under $20,000, you're screwed.

**Body:**
Just found out Florida is one of 10 states that rejected Medicaid expansion.

Make too little for ACA subsidies ($20,000 for single person). Make too much for Medicaid (basically $0 unless you're pregnant or disabled).

Fall in the gap? You get NOTHING. Zero help with healthcare.

I'm a gig worker in Jacksonville making $18,000/year. Can't afford the $450/month insurance with no subsidies. Can't get Medicaid either.

Living without insurance because Florida politics screwed us.

## POST 5: The Calculator (Value Post - Reddit/Facebook)
**Target:** r/selfemployed, r/personalfinance, entrepreneur Facebook groups

**Title:** Free calculator: Find your exact ACA subsidy cliff for 2026

**Body:**
If you're self-employed and on ACA insurance, you need to know your EXACT subsidy cliff number for next year.

Make $1 over that number = lose thousands in subsidies.

Made a free calculator that shows:
- Your exact cliff amount for 2026
- How much you'll lose if you go over
- Strategies to stay under it legally

Takes 30 seconds: https://dailyspark.info/calculate-your-cliff.html

Wish I'd had this before I screwed up my 2024 taxes and lost $11,479.
