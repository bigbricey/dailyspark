<p><em>Last updated: January 2025</em></p>
<p>"Great news! You've met your $10,000 deductible. Now you only pay 20%!"</p>
<p>Only. 
Only 20%.
Like 20% of catastrophic medical bills is pocket change.</p>
<p>My spine surgery was $87,000. My 20% "only" cost me $17,400. On top of the $10,000 deductible I'd already paid.</p>
<p>That's $27,400 for one surgery. But hey, at least I "only" paid 20% after the deductible!</p>
<h2>The Coinsurance Con Game</h2>
<p>Here's what they don't explain clearly when you sign up:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> You pay 100% until you hit $10,000 (deductible)
<strong>Phase 2:</strong> You pay 20% of everything after that
<strong>Phase 3:</strong> You pay until you hit out-of-pocket max ($15,000 typical)
<strong>Phase 4:</strong> Insurance finally covers 100%</p>
<p>Notice how you're still paying thousands in Phase 2? That's the coinsurance scam.</p>
<h2>Real Bills That Show the 20% Horror</h2>
<h3>The Cancer Treatment Nightmare</h3>
<p>My neighbor's breast cancer treatment:</p>
<p><strong>Deductible:</strong> $10,000 (paid)
<strong>Surgery:</strong> $45,000 x 20% = $9,000
<strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> $150,000 x 20% = $30,000
<strong>Radiation:</strong> $65,000 x 20% = $13,000
<strong>Scans/Tests:</strong> $25,000 x 20% = $5,000</p>
<p>Wait, that's $57,000 in coinsurance! </p>
<p>Out-of-pocket maximum "saves" her: Capped at $15,000</p>
<p>Total paid: $10,000 (deductible) + $5,000 (coinsurance to max) = $15,000</p>
<p>"Only" $15,000 for cancer. What a deal!</p>
<h3>My Spine Surgery Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>Pre-deductible costs:</strong> $10,000 (various appointments, MRIs, etc.)
<strong>Surgery cost:</strong> $87,000
<strong>My 20% coinsurance:</strong> $17,400
<strong>But wait...</strong>
<strong>Out-of-pocket max:</strong> $15,000
<strong>So I "only" paid:</strong> $5,000 more</p>
<p>Total for the year: $15,000
Insurance "saved" me: $12,400 in coinsurance
I still paid: A car's worth of money</p>
<h2>The Services Where 20% Destroys You</h2>
<h3>Specialty Drugs</h3>
<strong>Biologics for autoimmune disease:</strong> $8,000/month
<strong>Your 20%:</strong> $1,600/month
<strong>Annual coinsurance:</strong> $19,200 (until you hit max)</p>
<h3>Dialysis</h3>
<strong>Three sessions weekly:</strong> $30,000/month
<strong>Your 20%:</strong> $6,000/month
<strong>Three months bankrupts you</strong></p>
<h3>NICU Stay</h3>
<strong>Premature baby, 60 days:</strong> $500,000
<strong>Your 20%:</strong> $100,000
<strong>"Saved" by out-of-pocket max:</strong> Still paying $15,000 for your baby surviving</p>
<h3>Air Ambulance</h3>
<strong>Helicopter ride:</strong> $50,000
<strong>Your 20%:</strong> $10,000
<strong>For a 15-minute flight</strong></p>
<h2>The Math That Makes You Scream</h2>
<p>Let's say you need a procedure that costs $50,000:</p>
<p><strong>Without insurance:</strong> $50,000 (but negotiable, often reduced to $20,000 cash)</p>
<p><strong>With insurance (haven't met deductible):</strong> $50,000 (you pay all)</p>
<p><strong>With insurance (met deductible):</strong> $10,000 (your 20%)</p>
<p><strong>With insurance (met out-of-pocket max):</strong> $0</p>
<p>But to get to that $0, you've already paid $15,000 that year. So it's not really $0, is it?</p>
<h2>The January vs December Coinsurance Trap</h2>
<h3>January Surgery:</h3>
<ul><li>Pay $10,000 deductible</li>
<li>Pay 20% coinsurance until hitting $15,000 max</li>
<li>Rest of year: Everything covered!</li>
<li>Actually beneficial (if you can afford it)</li>
</ul>
<h3>December Surgery:</h3>
<ul><li>Already met deductible (maybe)</li>
<li>Pay 20% coinsurance</li>
<li>January 1st: RESET</li>
<li>Same surgery follow-up now costs full price again</li>
</ul>
<p>The same 20% coinsurance has completely different financial impacts based on the calendar.</p>
<h2>When 20% Equals Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Real examples where 20% destroyed families:</p>
<p><strong>Tom's Heart Transplant:</strong>
<ul><li>Procedure: $1,400,000</li>
<li>His 20%: $280,000</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket max "saved" him</li>
<li>Still paid: $15,000</li>
<li>Plus: Anti-rejection drugs forever at 20%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lisa's Premature Twins:</strong>
<ul><li>NICU bill: $2,100,000</li>
<li>Her 20%: $420,000</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket max: $15,000</li>
<li>Paid $15,000 while on unpaid maternity leave</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>David's Car Accident:</strong>
<ul><li>Multiple surgeries: $380,000</li>
<li>His 20%: $76,000</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket max: $15,000</li>
<li>Lost job during recovery, couldn't pay</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Out-of-Network Coinsurance Disaster</h2>
<p>Here's what they really don't tell you:</p>
<p><strong>In-network:</strong> 20% coinsurance counts toward out-of-pocket max</p>
<p><strong>Out-of-network:</strong> Could be 40% coinsurance with NO maximum</p>
<p>Emergency surgery, anesthesiologist is out-of-network:
<ul><li>Their bill: $15,000</li>
<li>Your 40%: $6,000</li>
<li>Doesn't count toward out-of-pocket max</li>
<li>You pay forever</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Alternative to Coinsurance Chaos</h2>
<p>This is where services like <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> make sense for routine care.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a>:
<ul><li>No coinsurance calculations</li>
<li>No percentage math</li>
<li>One flat rate</li>
<li>You know exactly what you'll pay</li>
</ul>
<p>For major medical events, you still need traditional insurance. But for the 90% of healthcare that's routine, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=114664&awinaffid=2516221&ued=https://myphysicianplan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyPhysicianPlan</a> removes the coinsurance confusion.</p>
<h2>The Psychology of "Only" 20%</h2>
<p>Insurance companies are masters of framing:</p>
<p>"You only pay 20%" sounds so much better than:
<ul><li>"You pay $17,400 of your $87,000 surgery"</li>
<li>"You pay $30,000 of your cancer treatment"</li>
<li>"You pay until we decide you've paid enough"</li>
</ul>
<p>That word "only" does heavy psychological lifting.</p>
<h2>Countries That Don't Do This</h2>
<p><strong>Germany:</strong> Maximum 2% of annual income for all healthcare
<strong>Japan:</strong> 30% coinsurance but monthly cap of ~$1,000
<strong>UK:</strong> 0% coinsurance. It's free.
<strong>France:</strong> 20% coinsurance but most have secondary insurance that covers it
<strong>USA:</strong> 20% until you're bankrupt or hit an arbitrary maximum</p>
<h2>The Coinsurance Shopping Impossibility</h2>
<p>Try asking for prices to calculate your 20%:</p>
<p>"How much will my surgery cost?"
"We won't know until after."</p>
<p>"Can I get an estimate?"
"It depends on many factors."</p>
<p>"How can I budget for 20% if I don't know the total?"
"🤷‍♀️"</p>
<p>You're expected to agree to pay 20% of a number nobody will tell you.</p>
<h2>Real People's Coinsurance Horror Stories</h2>
<p><strong>Mary, Teacher:</strong> "20% of my MS medications is $1,100/month. That's my mortgage."</p>
<p><strong>James, Contractor:</strong> "Kidney stones required lithotripsy. My 20% was $3,400. For a 30-minute procedure."</p>
<p><strong>Sandra, Freelancer:</strong> "Needed foot surgery. My 20% was $8,000. I'm still paying it off 3 years later."</p>
<h2>The Coinsurance Fine Print</h2>
<p>What counts toward coinsurance:
<ul><li>"Allowed amounts" (not actual bills)</li>
<li>In-network providers only</li>
<li>Approved procedures only</li>
<li>Correctly coded services only</li>
</ul>
<p>What doesn't count:
<ul><li>Balance billing</li>
<li>Out-of-network anything</li>
<li>Non-covered services</li>
<li>Billing errors (until fixed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck figuring out which is which!</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>20% coinsurance after meeting a $10,000 deductible isn't insurance - it's a discount program with a $10,000 entry fee.</p>
<p>You pay thousands to earn the right to pay 20% of bills that can reach hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>The insurance company acts like they're doing you a favor by "only" making you pay 20% of astronomical bills.</p>
<p>In any other industry, paying full price for something, then paying 20% of future purchases, wouldn't be called insurance. It would be called a scam.</p>
<p>But in healthcare, we're supposed to be grateful for the privilege of "only" paying 20% into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>That's not insurance. That's institutionalized theft with a percentage calculator.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>Note: Based on actual coinsurance bills and out-of-pocket experiences. Your 20% may vary based on how creatively your provider bills.</em></p>
